XMDB is meant to be a Python Django proof of concept and is a work in progress.
It makes use of The Open Movie Database API (OMDb API): http://omdbapi.com/
Current supported functionality includes account sign up and sign in, search functionality for
any movie that exists in the OMDb database, as well as ability to create personal movie libraries.
